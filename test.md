## Breakerspace Lab

The Breakerspace Lab is a growing suite of materials characterization instruments, located in 8-102A (accessed through the Breakerspace Lounge). In addition to the instruments, we have cameras, microphones, tripods, lighting, and other equipment that can be used to document projects.

**Hours:** The Breakerspace Lab is open 10 AM to 10 PM weekdays, and 12 PM to 5 PM weekends for trained users.
