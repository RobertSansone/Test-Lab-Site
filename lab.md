## Breakerspace Lab

![Lab on Breakerday!](./assets/img/breakerday.JPG)

The Breakerspace Lab is a growing suite of materials characterization instruments, located in 8-102A (accessed through the Breakerspace Lounge). In addition to the instruments, we have cameras, microphones, tripods, lighting, and other equipment that can be used to document projects.

**Hours:** The Breakerspace Lab is open 10 AM to 10 PM weekdays, and 12 PM to 5 PM weekends for trained users.

### Thermofisher Phenom XL SEM

### Horiba Duetta Fluorescence and Absorbance Spectrometer

![Horiba Duetta Fluorescence and Absorbance Spectrometer](./assets/img/uv-vis.JPG)

Duetta can be used as a fluorometer, as a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer to measure absorbance, or as an instrument that measures true molecular fingerprints, which require the acquisition of fluorescence and absorbance, correcting for IFE in real time.  

___

### Nicolet iS5 FTIR Spectrometer

![Nicolet iS5 FTIR Spectrometer](./assets/img/ftir.JPG)

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides an infrared spectrum of absorption or transmission of a solid, liquid, or gas, for identification, primarily, of organic or polymeric materials.

Perform IZOD testing at up to 50 joules on our impact testing system.

___

### Horiba XploRA Confocal Raman Microscope

![Horiba XploRA Confocal Raman Microscope](./assets/img/raman.JPG)

Collect Raman spectra to idenfity compounds and observe other characteristics of a range of materials on our instrument, which is configured with 532nm, 638nm and 785nm lasers, and 600, 1200, 1800, and 2400 gr/mm gratings. 

___

### Technoorg-Linda SEMPrep 2 Broad Beam Ion Mill

![Technoorg-Linda SEMPrep 2 Broad Beam Ion Mill](./assets/img/ion-mill.JPG)

Our ion mill enables damage free sample prep for SEM imaging. It is equipped with two ion guns: a high-energy gun with a 2-16 keV range, and a low-energy gun with a 0.1-2 keV range. We have sample holders for polishing, and for 30째 and 90째 slope cutting, with a handy microscope to help with sample alignment. Our LN2 cooling option allows milling of heat-sensitive samples with good temperature control.

___

### Innovatest Nemesis 5100G2 Hardness Tester

![Innovatest Nemesis 5100G2 Hardness Tester](./assets/img/hardness-tester.JPG)

This hardness tester has a 9-position turret to automatically swith between indenters and objectives, and uses a load cell to measure applied load. It also has an XY stage, and can be programmed to run test patterns. The Breakerspace system is equipped with indenters for Vickers, Rockwell, and Brinell, and can run a range of scales.

___
