The DMSE Breakerspace welcomes all MIT undergraduates to explore the world of materials through hands-on experiences with powerful desktop materials characterization instruments. More than just a laboratory, it’s a dynamic hub for multidisciplinary learning, encouraging students to pursue their own questions. The Breakerspace also features a lounge for relaxing, socializing, and enjoying espresso — an inclusive space for academic exploration and leisure. 

### Training, access, and hours:

The Breakerspace lab and lounge are both open 8 AM to midnight, seven days/week.
