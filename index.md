The DMSE Breakerspace welcomes all MIT undergraduates to explore the world of materials science and engineering through hands-on experiences with powerful desktop materials characterization instruments. More than just a laboratory, it’s a dynamic hub for multidisciplinary learning, encouraging students to pursue their own questions. The Breakerspace also features a lounge for relaxing, socializing, and enjoying espresso — an inclusive space for academic exploration and leisure.

### Access:
Location: Room 8-102 (directly off the infinite corridor!). The lab is accessed through the lounge.

Lab and lounge open hours: 8 AM to midnight, 7 days/week.

The lab and lounge are open to all Breakerspace users under MIT tap ID access during open hours.

To become a user of the Breakerspace, complete your first training on any instrument. Trainings are given in person by a laboratory assisstant. It may take up to 24-48 hours after completion of the training to receive tap ID access.
