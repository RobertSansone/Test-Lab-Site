## Overview:

Matches info/image for instrument on lab page, brief description of what it does/how it works/what materials it's used for

### Index:

* [Materials and sample prep](#materials)
* [Detailed operating instructions](#details)
* [Data processing and analysis](#data)
* [Common failure modes](#failures)
* [Manufacturer manuals](#manuals)

* [Exercises](#exercises)

<a name="sop"></a>
### Standard operating protocol:

<a name="startup"></a> 
#### Instrument startup:

* sequence of powering on, logging in, starting softare, homing/tilt position etc.
* these steps should only need to be completed once per session
* no images on page in this section, just text bullets, [text can link to image if needed](../assets/img/tutorials/template/ftir-switch.JPG)

<a name="operation"></a>
#### Operation: 

* steps to characterize - sample loading, data capture and saving, etc. - whatever might be repeated, characterization sequence
* for instruments like SEM with multiple, independent characterization techniques (eg. EDS, imaging), make technique a top-level bullet and indent for steps
	* this is tabbed in to be a sub-set of the above bullet

<a name="shutdown"></a>
####  Instrument shut down:

* sequence to close/log off/power down as needed - whatever is done once at the conclusion of a session
* highlight important steps in bold (ie. __make sure UV-Vis lamp is OFF__)
* these steps should need to be performed once at the end of a characterization session

<a name="materials"></a> 
### Compatible materials and sample prep: 

* compatible materials
* incompatible materials
* safety/handling related info
* images/videos inline as needed

#### Sample Prep may be own sub-section:

* sample prep
	* break into sub-sections as relevant, 
	* ie. solid vs. powder vs. liquid

<a name="details"></a> 
### Detailed operating instructions: 

* include sample loading/unloading
* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
* software features
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="data"></a>
### Data processing and analysis:

* what softare we recommend
* typical steps
* fill in with more detail as time allows, and/or add standalone data processing tutorials
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* these are where people frequently get stuck
* example may include starting DSX software before microscope powered up
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="manuals"></a>
### Manufacturer's manuals:

* Links to manual files in dropbox

<a name="links"></a>
### Links:

* list of links, ie. good video tutorials, some student project, anything relevant

<a name="exercises"></a>
### Exercises:

* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.
