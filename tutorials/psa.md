 If the tray is contaminated with particles from a previous sample, remove them before starting the sequence. The tray can be removed to be cleaned separately, and debris tends to get trapped between the tray and the slab that it sits on. Once the tray is clean use the Â¼ tsp measure next to the machine to load your sample into the slot. Keep your sample behind the the marker at the front, so that a background test can be run before the sample is processed. Next, click Auto-Sequence in the top left. You will be prompted to title your sample and add a note. When the test is finished, name your file and save it.
